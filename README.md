## Water Potential
### Vocabulary
- **Osmosis**: the diffusion of water
  * Diffusion: the movement of a substance from an area of high concentration to an area of lower concentration
- **Hypertonic**: higher conceentration of water in solution than water concentration in a cell (the cell will get bigger)
- **Hypotonic**: lower concentration of water in solution than water concentration in a cell (the cell will shrink)
- **isotonic**: same water concentration between solution and a cell (the size of the cell does not change)

### Formula
- **Water Potential = Pressure Potential + Solute Potential**
  * Solute Potential = -iCRT
  * i: ionization constant (2 for NaCl)
  * C: molar concentration
  * R: pressure constant
  * T: temperature (in degrees K; degrees Celsius+273)

## Calculating the Percent Change Mass
- **[(Final Mass-Initial Mass)(100)]/Initial Mass**
